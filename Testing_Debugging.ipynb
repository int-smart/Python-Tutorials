    "2. If you can not come up with such boundaries go for random test cases and check for correctness of your code.\n",
    "3. Black box testing: Here we test according to the specifications described in the docstring of a function. So the code for the function does not matter in this case. We can get different test cases from the specification like the boundaries, extremes, normal cases etc.\n",
    "4. Glass Box testing: This type of testing derives the test cases from the code itself. The test cases that go through each path through the code are called path complete. In case of loops however they are hard to find. For a for loop we would needa test case which does the test when the loop runs zero times, once, twice, and so on."
